# Earthly-Navigation
This code in Python can be modified to show heading in degrees from point A to point B and the distance in miles between points A and B


This is some sample output....

radians  2.577496410291739
Degrees 147.67966601983665
Distance in Miles  217.29710854960138

The above calculation is the heading and distance from the Tower of London, in London to the Arc de Triumphe in Paris

There are multiple figures for the number of miles per degree of longtitude/lattitude. Generally it's 69 and 48 miles(ish).
It seems the Earth is more of a rugby-ball shape than a soccer ball shape.
